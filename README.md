The website I have created is completed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have implemented various features, such as a scroll feature for reviewing customer reviews, different hover effects on buttons and images, and the functionality to scroll back to the top of the page using an arrow button created with JavaScript. Additionally, I have incorporated onclick features on buttons using JavaScript and so on .
